## Monthly Progress Log

### 🗓️ September 2025

> My primary activity in September was consistently working through the PortSwigger Web Security Academy labs, which allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to hands-on challenges. A major highlight was progressing through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate on Coursera, which provided a broad and structured understanding of the cybersecurity landscape.

#### Key Learnings

  * **Web Application Security:** Deepened my understanding by working extensively on practical PortSwigger labs covering a range of common vulnerabilities.
  * **Vulnerability Analysis:** Gained specific, practical knowledge of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Path Traversal, and various Business Logic Vulnerabilities.
  * **Comprehensive Cybersecurity Fundamentals:** Acquired broad knowledge through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, covering topics from security frameworks and risk assessment to network security and threat intelligence.

#### Vulnerabilities Studied

  * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Gained hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting SSRF vulnerabilities, understanding its impact on internal systems.
  * **Path Traversal:** Learned to exploit file path traversal vulnerabilities to access restricted files and directories.
  * **Business Logic Vulnerabilities:** Explored flaws in application logic that could be exploited for unintended purposes.

#### Tools & Platforms

  * **Primary Tool:** Continued extensive use of `` `Burp Suite` `` for all web application testing.
  * **Platforms & Challenges:**
      * **PortSwigger Web Security Academy:** Focused on completing labs for SSRF, Path Traversal, and Business Logic Vulnerabilities.
      * **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate:** Actively progressed through modules on Coursera.
      * **Specialization Task:** Continued work on the assigned specialization task.

#### Live Findings & Bug Bounties

  * 🔒 **Status:** All activities were conducted in controlled lab environments. No live vulnerabilities were reported.

### 🗓️ August 2025

> This past month has been a period of intensive learning, building directly on the foundational knowledge I gained in late July. My journey progressed from reconnaissance to more advanced topics like Web Application, API, and even iOS Security, with a strong focus on practical application.

#### Key Learnings

  * **Network Security:** Gained a deeper understanding of network scanning and methodologies (CEH Module 4).
  * **Enumeration:** Learned the principles and techniques of enumeration (CEH Module 5).
  * **Web Application Security:** Studied advanced modules on web app architecture and common security flaws.
  * **Vulnerability Analysis:** Acquired specific knowledge on the mechanics, impact, and mitigation of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
  * **API & Mobile Security:** Gained foundational knowledge of API security concepts and iOS application architecture.

#### Vulnerabilities Studied

  * **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Gained hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting different types of CSRF vulnerabilities.
  * **Information Disclosure:** Learned to identify vulnerabilities from network scanning and footprinting (e.g., open ports, service banners).
  * **API Security Risks:** Introduced to common risks like insecure endpoints and improper data handling.

#### Tools & Platforms

  * **Reconnaissance & Scanning:** `` `knockpy` ``, `` `httpx` ``, `` `subfinder` ``, `` `Nmap` ``
  * **Web & API Testing:** `` `Burp Suite` ``, `` `Postman` ``
  * **Information Gathering:** `` `Google Dorks` ``
  * **Platforms & Challenges:**
      * **PortSwigger Web Security Academy:** Completed labs focused on CSRF.
      * **Try Hack Me:** Completed rooms focusing on Web Fundamentals.
      * **Internal Assignments:** Worked on Task 2 (Advanced), Task 3, and Specialization Task 4.
      * **Personal Lab:** Set up a multi-VM lab for remote access and network practice.

#### Live Findings & Bug Bounties

  * 🔒 **Status:** The primary objective was skill acquisition in a training environment. No live vulnerabilities were reported.
